<p>
This page allows you to update or rebuild the index used by the full-text search.
This is generally not needed as the index builds and updates itself as
users browse your wiki. However if you just upgraded, added or removed
a lot of files it may be a good idea to clean up the index.
</p>

<p>
Rebuilding the index <strong>can take a long time</strong>. You should leave the page open
until the indexing has finished.
